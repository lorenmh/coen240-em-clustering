Run w/ Octave 4.2.1, using gnuplot to plot, MacOS X

The script which performs EM clustering is in:
em.m

This script reads the data in simple_iris_dataset.dat and performs EM
clustering on it. The final result is 2 vectors of weights corresponding to the
probability that an example belongs to that cluster. The results are plotted
with the centroid of each respective cluster.
